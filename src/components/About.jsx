	+ 'Toddlerpillars. So many of their ideas have been incorporated into the project that they have become more like a hive mind of collaborators than a community of fans.',
	'Jon and Tim have developed a detailed lore for the Toddlerpillars, which finds our little friends in a parallel universe that is set to collide with our own. The project has a detailed roadmap which extends way beyond the mint, with a companion collection, the Chimerapillars, a 100+ page graphic novel exploring the lore, IRL collectable toys, jewellery, merchandise, international meetups for holders and much more!'];
