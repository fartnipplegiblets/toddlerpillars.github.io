	+ 'art. Starting out as an artist with a simple website showcasing his art, Jon '
	+ 'grew that website into an artistic community, gaining a respectable global '
	+ 'following. He built on this by publishing art books and curating group '
	+ 'exhibitions in the United States before reassessing his pursuits and co-'
	+ 'founding the Beinart Gallery with Corinne Leita in Melbourne, Australia.',

	+ 'nightmarish storylines soaked heavily in delusion, confusion and a general '
	+ 'sense of unease. I draw heavily on surrealist techniques, symbolist ideas, '
	+ 'synchronicity and dreams to construct my stories. Recurring themes include '
	+ '(but are not exclusive to) death, rebirth, the nature and expansion of '
	+ 'consciousness, self-destruction and discovery... There is a kind of pre-'
	+ 'apocalyptic tension throughout, balanced (I hope) with a sense of humor that '
	+ 'stops it all from getting too serious..."'];
