	+ 'friends in a parallel universe that is set to collide with our own.',

	+ ' Toddlerpillars, which were originally birthed in 2002. These sculptures were'
	+ ' published widely in art books and popular magazines and they frequently went'
	+ ' viral, reaching all corners of the internet. They were also exhibited in a number'
	+ ' of galleries and museums.',
	'In 2011 Jon moved on from this series of sculptures to focus on his oil'
	+ ' paintings. In 2016 he opened Beinart Gallery with Corinne Leita in Melbourne'
	+ ' Australia. This NFT project marks Jon\'s return to one of his earliest artistic'
	+ ' creations, the Toddlerpillars, in a partnership with the incredible illustrator, Tim Molloy.'];
